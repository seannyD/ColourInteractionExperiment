# Introduction

This analysis looks at the sign variants used in a colour naming game between signers of different sign languages meeting after 1 week of interaction and after 3 weeks of interaction.  The data was collected by Kang Suk Byun (Kang-Suk.Byun@mpi.nl).

The analysis tries to predict the relative frequency of each variant within a colour category in week 3, based on measures from week 1.

# Load data

```{r}
variants = read.csv('../data/processedData/variants_summary.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
```

There were only 2 variants for `white', and one of those only appeared once.  Therefore, we remove it from this statistical analysis.

```{r}
variants = variants[variants$colourName!='white',]
```


Transform some variables.

```{r}

variants$Teach = variants$Teach >0

variants$check.any = variants$check>0

variants$freq_week_1.logcenter = log(variants$freq_week_1 + 1)
variants$freq_week_1.logcenter = 
  variants$freq_week_1.logcenter - mean(variants$freq_week_1.logcenter)

# cut TryMarking into two categories
variants$TryMarked.cat = cut(variants$TryMarked, 
                             c(-Inf,3,Inf), 
                             labels = c("Low",'High')) 

variants$averageLength_week_1.logcenter = log(variants$averageLength_week_1)
variants$averageLength_week_1.logcenter = 
  variants$averageLength_week_1.logcenter -
    mean(variants$averageLength_week_1.logcenter)
