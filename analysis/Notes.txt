Issue 1)

There are some strange sign labels in the corpus.  Should these be taken out?

SAME
DIFFERENT
UNDERSTAND
DO NOT UNDERSTAND
ME
YOU
YES
NOT
SIGNING

Issue 2)

There are a few very long signs.  Maybe there is a problem with the coding?  Or maybe the sign is being repeated several times?  If so, this should be broken up into separate annotations.  This means it can be counted as several repetitions.

Issue 3)

There is a sign in the ELAN files called "LW:STRUT+IX" (Week 1, Indonesia&India, 0:11:12).  What should the variant label be for this?  Is it the same as "STRUT", or should it be different?
