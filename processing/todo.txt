"Yes" is positive, blank is not.

Get the T-1 value:
Find annotations in the T-1 tier (named "T-1_Repair") that occur in the times of the sign annotation (+ or - 50 milliseconds).
		If there is an annotation, and it is "Yes" then *this sign is a problem source*
		
		
		Change millisecond window:
		
		Get the teaching value:
		Find annotations in the teaching tier ("Teach Sign_1", "Teach Sign_2") that occur 		within the times of the sign annotation (+ or - 50 milliseconds).
		
		
Check tier names: ("T0/Check_1", "repair initiation_1","Repair 	initiation_1","T0/check_1","T0/Check_2", "repair initiation_2","Repair 	initiation_2","T0/check_2" )

CHECK TIERS
	For each annotation in the check tier ("T0/Check_1", "repair initiation_1","Repair 	initiation_1","T0/check_1","T0/Check_2", "repair initiation_2","Repair 	initiation_2","T0/check_2" )(within this trial):
	
		All of these signs *are T0Check signs*
		
		Get candidate understanding value:
 		Find annotations in the candidate understanding tier 					("T0_1_candidate(understand)”, “T0_2_candidate(understand)") that occur within the times 	of the sign annotation (+ or - 50 milliseconds).
			If there is an annotation, and the annotation label is "Yes", then *this is a 			candidate understanding form*
